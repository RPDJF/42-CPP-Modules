# 🚀 42 CPP Modules
Ahoy, fellow code sailors! Welcome to my GitHub harbor, where the epic tales of the 42 CPP Modules project unfold. Dive into the coding seas, but remember, face the challenges alone before setting sail with my solutions, savvy?

## What are CPP Modules Anyway?
CPP Modules is a collection of modules that will take you on a coding adventure like no other. It's like embarking on a quest to conquer the world of C++ and unlock its hidden treasures! ⚔️🌍

## Cloning the Repository
Simply cast this spell, and you're on board the ship:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RPDJF/42-CPP-Modules.git
```

## Execute-it! 💻 

Just a few magic spells to conjure your 42 CPP Modules masterpiece:

- `cd <module_directory>`: Step into the realm of the module you're working on. Replace `<module_directory>` with the name of your module.
- `make`: For a regular enchantment. Compile that code, and you're ready for the grand C++ performance!
- `make bonus`: Feeling adventurous? Add the bonus ingredients for an extra C++ crescendo.
- `make clean`: Clear away the traces of your enchantment. A tidy workspace is a powerful workspace.
- `make fclean`: Need a clean slate? This erases all enchantments, leaving nothing behind.
- `make debug`: Unleash the debug sorcery using gdb. Warning: It leaves behind extra mystical artifacts not handled by `make fclean`.

Navigate this mystical realm with these commands, and may your 42 CPP Modules journey be legendary! 🌟🔮

Happy coding, fellow wizards! 🧙‍♂️🔍
